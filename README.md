# Explore-Weather-Trends

## Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree Project1 : _Explore Weather Trends_ 

In this project, I will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends by using SQL and Google sheets.

### Instructions

1. _Extract the data from the database._
      - Write a SQL query to extract the city level data. Export to CSV.
      - Write a SQL query to extract the global data. Export to CSV.

2. _Open up the CSV using Google sheets_

3. _Create a line chart_ that compares my city’s temperatures with the global temperatures. Make sure to plot the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable.

4. _Make observations_ about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your city’s averages, as well as overall trends. Here are some questions to get you started.
